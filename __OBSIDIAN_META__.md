I use this file to explain to myself what conventions etc I'm using in Obsidian. Entirely optional.

## What is an Atom?

- An [[atom]] is a unit of knowledge or concept that is self-contained. It may link to other atoms (kind of like the way an atom is considered a unit that interacts with other atoms) and even require understanding of other atoms to understand the current atom (now we are getting loose with the accuracy of the chemistry analogy, but this is akin to understanding what an atom is by understanding that protons, neutrons, and electrons form it)
- 

## What is a Molecule?

- A [[molecule]] is a note that synthesizes ideas / connects atoms to form a unique realization or insight. These do not need to be your own take-aways necessarily -- they can be insights taken from a source too
- Molecules should be written in your own 

## What is a Source?

- A source can be any media that you take notes on (textbook, podcast, article, even a tweet)
- What are the different source types (i.e tags)? 
	- Totally up to you!
	- I use the following as of now
		- academic (published research papers, airxiv pre-prints, etc.)
		- textbook
		- book
		- substack
		- tweet
		- podcast
		- lecture (university video lectures, pptx slides, etc.)
		- documentation (like for Python packages)
		- misc. (anything that does not fit into an above bucket nicely -- I try to stay away from using a catch-all if possible)
		
## What is a Topic?

- A Topic is a vague discretionary categorization that helps to organize your atoms and molecules


## Misc: How to process information 

- Atoms and Molecules should be **written in your own words** to facilitate understanding
- Utility over comprehensiveness (i.e. pointers and connection over collection and copying)
	- Briefly read over a source to get an idea of the concepts that will be presented and what is important (for atoms, molecules, etc.)
	- Read over a source a **second time** actually taking your molecular notes
		- This will improve retention and allow you to focus on the material rather than quality molecular note-taking at first, which could be distracting from the actual subject material
